# Contributions and Workflow

Contributions to the project are welcome from anyone!

## Pull Requests

For now, all org members simply have write access to the repository. We want to keep the development hassle-free, and for now the stakes are low and we trust each other.

However, we should all follow the following consensus w.r.t the development workflow:

 - Do everything via PRs. No pushing directly to master.
 - Use "Squash & Merge" when merging PRs, to keep commit history clean.
 - Simple changes like fixing typos or bumping dependencies can be merged without discussion, even by the author.
 - For everything else:
   - Do not merge your own PRs. Have someone else press the button.
   - Have at least one other person review the changes.
   - Do not merge until any feedback on the PR is discussed / addressed.
